Key assumptions used in the minimum funding calculation using the NRC methodology at December 31 , 2019 include : ( 1 ) consideration of costs only for the removal of radiological contamination at each unit ; ( 2 ) the option on a unit - by - unit basis to use generic , non - site specific cost estimates ; ( 3 ) consideration of only one decommissioning scenario for each unit ; ( 4 ) the plants cease operation at the end of their current license lives ( with no assumed license renewals for those units that have not already received renewals ) ; ( 5 ) the assumption of current nominal dollar cost estimates that are neither escalated through the anticipated period of decommissioning , nor discounted using the CARFR ; and ( 6 ) assumed annual after - tax returns on the NDT funds of 2 % ( 3 % for the former PECO units , as specified by the PAPUC ) . In contrast , the key criteria and assumptions used by Generation to determine the ARO and to forecast the target growth in the NDT funds at December 31 , 2019 include : ( 1 ) the use of site specific cost estimates that are updated at least once every five years ; ( 2 ) the inclusion in the ARO estimate of all legally unavoidable costs required to decommission the unit ( e.g. , radiological decommissioning and full site restoration for certain units , on - site spent fuel maintenance and storage subsequent to ceasing operations and until DOE acceptance , and disposal of certain low - level radioactive waste ) ; ( 3 ) the consideration of multiple scenarios where decommissioning and site restoration activities , as applicable , are completed under possible scenarios ranging from 10 to 70 years after the cessation of plant operations ; ( 4 ) the consideration of multiple end of life scenarios ; ( 5 ) the measurement of the obligation at the present value of the future estimated costs and an annual average accretion of the ARO of approximately 5 % through a period of approximately 30 years after the end of the extended lives of the units ; and ( 6 ) an estimated targeted annual pre - tax return on the NDT funds of 5.4 % to 6.5 % ( as compared to a historical 5 - year annual average pre - tax return of approximately 6.7 % ) .
