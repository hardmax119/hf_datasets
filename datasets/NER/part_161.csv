Level 2-Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices , such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities ; quoted prices in markets that are not active ; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities . Level 3-Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities . Typically , assets and liabilities are considered to be fair valued on a recurring basis if fair value is measured regularly .",No XBRL associated data.
