The valuation techniques that may be used to measure fair value are as follows : • Market approach - Uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities ; • Income approach - Uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount based on current market expectation about those future amounts ; • Cost approach - Based on the amount that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset ( replacement cost ) .
