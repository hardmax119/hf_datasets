however , players may not widely download our games for a variety of reasons , including : ● competition for downloads not only with other mobile games but also with social media and other non - gaming related applications ; ● limits on the number of mobile applications players are willing to download to and maintain on their devices ; ● poor consumer reviews or other negative publicity ; ● ineffective or insufficient marketing efforts ; ● lack of sufficient social and community features ; ● lack of prominent storefront featuring ; ● failure to reach and maintain Top Free App Store rankings ; ● the relatively large file size of some of our games ; in particular , our games often utilize a significant amount of the available memory on a user ’ s device and tend to consume additional space as players advance through our games , which may cause players to delete our games once the file size grows beyond the capacity of their devices ’ storage limitations ; ● the limitations set by Apple , which at most only allow applications that are less than 200 megabytes , to be downloaded over a carrier ’ s wireless network ; as a result , players must download our iOS games that exceed 200 megabytes via a wireless Internet ( Wi - Fi ) connection . ● even if our games are widely downloaded , we may fail to retain users or optimize the monetization of these games ; this may occur for a variety of reasons , including poor game design or quality , lack of social and community features , gameplay issues such as game unavailability , long load times or an unexpected termination of the game due to data server or other technical issues , lack of differentiation from predecessor games or other competitive games , lack of innovative features that surprise and delight our players , differences in user demographics and purchasing power or our failure to effectively respond and adapt to changing user preferences through game updates ; ● future games that we release may fail to resonate with consumers and games that incorporate licensed property may not be financially successful due to the minimum guaranteed royalty payments to our licensors ; ● we intend to continue to develop games based upon our own intellectual property , in addition to well - known licensed brands and properties , and we may encounter difficulties in generating sufficient consumer interest in and downloads of our original intellectual property games ; ● many well - funded public and private companies have released , or plan to release , games in the same genres as our growth games or games incorporating the same licensed brands that we intend to use in our games ( e.g. , WWE and Disney / Pixar ) , and this competition will make it more difficult for us to differentiate our games and derive significant revenue from them ;
